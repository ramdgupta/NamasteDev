Namste React 24/12/2022
add cdn react file in your index.html
at browser console.log 
type 
React
React.createElment
ReactDOM

react@18
	This file  is version of react
	This is core file of react
react-dom@18 
	This file this web version of react 
	This file accesses dom of page 
	

In React crete element : React.createElement
React.createElement("h1", {}, "Namaste Everyone!"};

In React Create Root Element:ReactDom.createRoot
	ReactDOM it's Document object model
	CreateRoot tail what you pass in this become root
	ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
	React is override whatever inside root
	React
	{}, there is paramaeter go like id, class, index etc
Can we have multiple root?
	In generally all aplication only have single root and render method
	everything we will build we build inside it.

Passing a React element in to dom : root.render
root.render(heading);

What will we see use ?
console.log(heading);
	React element is an object 
	React is not JSX
	It's plane Javascript object

What is CDN ?
